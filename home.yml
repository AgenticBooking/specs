faqs:
  - question: "What are A2A Specs?"
    answer: "A2A (Agent-to-Agent) Specs are open standards that define how AI agents communicate with hospitality systems. They enable any AI assistant to book hotels, reserve tables, or plan experiences using a common language."

  - question: "How do I implement A2A in my system?"
    answer: "Start with our SDK (`npm i @a2a/sdk`) which provides TypeScript types and validation. Then expose your inventory using the Bookable protocol and your venue data using the Venue protocol."

  - question: "Is A2A compatible with existing booking systems?"
    answer: "Yes! A2A is designed as a layer on top of existing systems. You can gradually adopt protocols - start with read-only Venue data, then add Bookable inventory when ready."

  - question: "What about security and payments?"
    answer: "A2A focuses on discovery and availability. Actual transactions flow through your existing secure payment rails. The specs include authentication patterns for agent verification."

  - question: "Can I contribute to the specs?"
    answer: "Absolutely! A2A is open source and community-driven. Join our GitHub discussions, propose RFC changes, or help improve documentation."
