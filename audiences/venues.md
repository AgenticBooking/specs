# For Venues

What hospitality businesses need to know about being AI-bookable.

---

::note
Guests are starting to use AI agents to book travel. "Find me a dog-friendly hotel in Devon" → Agent searches, compares, books. If your venue isn't represented in a way agents understand, you won't be found.
::

## What you need to do

::steps
  ::step{title="Publish structured data"}
  Not just a website — structured information agents can parse. What you are, what you offer, your policies. This is what the [Venue protocol](/protocols/venue) defines.
  ::

  ::step{title="Connect availability"}
  Agents need to check if you have space. API or channel manager integration with real-time availability. This is what [Bookable](/protocols/bookable) enables.
  ::

  ::step{title="Get endorsed"}
  Agents trust Curators. Being endorsed by your DMO or a respected guide means higher visibility and more confident recommendations. See [Curator](/protocols/curator).

## What agents will know about you

::card-group{cols=3}
  ::card{title="Identity" icon="ph:identification-card"}
  What you are (hotel, restaurant, bar), where you are, how to contact you.
  ::

  ::card{title="Offer" icon="ph:door"}
  Rooms, tables, facilities. What's bookable and at what terms.
  ::

  ::card{title="Policies" icon="ph:clipboard-text"}
  Cancellation, pets, accessibility, check-in times. The rules of staying.
  ::

  ::card{title="Evidence" icon="ph:check-circle"}
  Third-party verifications, ratings, certifications. Proof, not claims.
  ::

  ::card{title="Vibe" icon="ph:sparkle"}
  The feel of your place. "Cosy country pub" vs "Sleek city bar."
  ::

  ::card{title="Answers" icon="ph:chat-circle-text"}
  Pre-composed responses to common questions agents can quote.
  ::
::

## What you don't need to do

::card-group{cols=3}
  ::card{title="Build AI" icon="ph:robot"}
  You don't need your own AI. Agents handle the intelligence.
  ::

  ::card{title="New systems" icon="ph:gear"}
  The specs work with existing infrastructure — PMS, channel manager, booking engine.
  ::

  ::card{title="Abandon OTAs" icon="ph:x-circle"}
  This is a new channel, not a replacement. Keep what works.
  ::
::

## Common questions

::accordion{title="Will this replace OTAs?"}
AI agents are a new channel, not necessarily a replacement. They may book through OTAs or directly, depending on what's available. Think of it as another distribution path.
::

::accordion{title="Do I need to pay for endorsement?"}
Legitimate Curators don't sell endorsements. They endorse based on quality and must declare any commercial relationships. If someone's selling "premium placement," they're not following the Curator manifesto.
::

::accordion{title="What if an agent gets it wrong?"}
Agents work from the data published. If your data is accurate and structured, agents will represent you accurately. Bad data in = bad recommendations out.
::

## Next steps

::steps
  ::step{title="Audit your data"}
  Review what structured data you currently publish. Is it accurate? Complete? Machine-readable?
  ::

  ::step{title="Check integrations"}
  Does your booking system support API integration? Talk to your PMS provider.
  ::

  ::step{title="Contact your DMO"}
  Ask about Curator endorsement. They may already be preparing.
  ::

  ::step{title="Get in touch"}
  Reach out to discuss implementation support.
