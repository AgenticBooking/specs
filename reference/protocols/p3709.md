# IEEE P3709 Agentic Systems

The industrial standard for enterprise-grade AI agents.

---

## What is P3709?

IEEE P3709 is the architectural standard for agentic systems, formalised in late 2024 and seeing wide enterprise adoption in 2026. While protocols like A2A and MCP define *how* agents communicate and use tools, P3709 defines the governance requirements that make agents suitable for regulated industries.

::callout{type="info"}
If A2A is the language agents speak, P3709 is the building code that ensures the house they live in doesn't fall down.

## The Four Pillars

P3709 mandates standards in four areas:

::card-group{cols="2"}
  ::card{title="Planning & Reasoning" icon="ph:brain"}
  Documented reasoning, goal decomposition, and decision traceability.
  ::
  ::card{title="Lifecycle Management" icon="ph:arrows-clockwise"}
  Standardised states from initialisation through termination.
  ::
  ::card{title="Safety & Guardrails" icon="ph:shield-check"}
  Egress gates and safety policy enforcement layers.
  ::
  ::card{title="Agent Identity" icon="ph:identification-card"}
  Verifiable ownership, spending limits, and capability manifests.
  ::
::

---

## Planning & Reasoning

P3709 requires agents to have a documented Planning Engine.

### Traceability

The agent must export a log of its reasoning:

```json
{
  "decision": "selected_venue",
  "venueId": "the-roste-burnton",
  "reasoning": {
    "consideredAlternatives": ["queens-hotel", "riverside-inn"],
    "selectionCriteria": ["dog-friendly", "within-budget", "curator-endorsed"],
    "rejectionReasons": {
      "queens-hotel": "No pet policy",
      "riverside-inn": "Outside date range"
    }
  },
  "timestamp": "2026-01-23T14:30:00Z"
}
```

### Goal Decomposition

Standards for breaking high-level goals into sub-tasks, preventing infinite reasoning loops:

```
Goal: "Book a romantic weekend in Eastshire"
├── Sub-task: Identify suitable region
├── Sub-task: Query curator for recommendations
├── Sub-task: Filter by availability
├── Sub-task: Compare pricing
├── Sub-task: Confirm with user
└── Sub-task: Create booking
```

---

## Lifecycle & State Management

P3709 defines four stages of an agent's lifecycle:

::card-group{cols="2"}
  ::card{title="Initialisation" icon="ph:play"}
  How an agent boots up and declares its permissions—capability manifest publication, permission scope declaration, resource allocation.
  ::
  ::card{title="Execution" icon="ph:gear"}
  Standardised status codes for agent state during operation.
  ::
  ::card{title="Hand-off" icon="ph:arrows-left-right"}
  Formal rules for task delegation between agents. Integrates with A2A protocol.
  ::
  ::card{title="Termination" icon="ph:stop"}
  Clean shutdown requirements—temporary memory deletion, session state cleanup, audit log finalisation.
  ::
::

### Execution Status Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `AGENT_READY` | Awaiting instructions |
| `AGENT_BUSY` | Processing request |
| `PLAN_REVISED` | Goal decomposition changed |
| `RESOURCE_DENIED` | Blocked by safety gate |
| `AWAITING_APPROVAL` | Human-in-the-loop checkpoint |

---

## Safety & Guardrails

P3709 provides a framework for Egress Gates:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  AI Model (reasoning layer)                                 │
└─────────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────┘
                              │ proposed action
                              ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  P3709 Safety Policy Enforcement                            │
│  • Spending limits                                          │
│  • Data access controls                                     │
│  • Action whitelists                                        │
│  • Human approval gates                                     │
└─────────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────┘
                              │ approved action
                              ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  External Tool (MCP) / Agent (A2A) / API (Connect)          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

This allows organisations to swap AI models while keeping the same P3709-compliant safety gate.

## Agent Identity

P3709 works with ANP (Agent Network Protocol) to ensure every agent has verifiable identity:

| Requirement | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| Organisation ID | Who owns the agent |
| Spending Limits | Maximum transaction authority |
| Agent Card | Current capabilities and limitations |
| Audit Trail | Decision history for compliance |

---

## Alignment with Agentic Booking

### Strong Coverage

| P3709 Requirement | Agentic Booking |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Agent Identity | Trust → Identity, Credentials |
| Lifecycle Management | Building Blocks → Stay |
| Hand-off Rules | Building Blocks → Curator |
| Capability Manifest | Connect capabilities |

### Areas for Extension

| P3709 Requirement | Gap |
|-------------------|-----|
| Audit Trail | No standard reasoning log schema |
| Safety Enforcement | No formal egress gate specification |
| Liability Limits | Folio covers payment, not liability |
| Status Codes | Stay has stages, not P3709 codes |

---

## Compliance Levels

For organisations implementing Agentic Booking:

::card-group{cols="3"}
