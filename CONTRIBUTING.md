# Contributing

These are working specifications. We use them in production. They will evolve.

## How to contribute

**Found a problem?** Open an issue. Describe what's wrong.

**Have a fix?** Submit a PR. Keep it focused.

**Want to discuss?** Start a discussion. We're happy to talk through ideas before you write code.

## What we're looking for

- Spec clarifications where the language is ambiguous
- Examples that demonstrate edge cases
- Schema corrections
- Documentation improvements
- Implementation feedback from real-world use

## What we're not looking for

- Scope expansion without clear use cases
- Theoretical improvements without implementation experience
- Breaking changes without migration paths

## Process

1. Open an issue describing the change
2. Discuss until there's rough agreement
3. Submit a PR
4. Review and merge

## Style

- Be direct
- Show examples
- Explain rationale

We're not precious about this. If something doesn't work, say so.
